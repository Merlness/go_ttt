## Tic Tac Toe in Go

Hi! This is my simple Tic Tac Toe game in Go.

To begin let's [install Go!](https://go.dev/doc/install)

Install whatever plugins you need for IDE. 

For example, I use JetBrains. So I installed this [plugin.](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/)

### Run the Game

Navigate to the directory where you have the game files. Then, to start the game type:

    go run .

Don't forget to have a good time, since you won't be able to beat my AI!


### Running Tests

If you want to run the tests to make sure everything is working properly, you can do so with:

    go test
